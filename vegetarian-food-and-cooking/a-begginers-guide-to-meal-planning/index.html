Write the days of the week on the left side of the page and the meals you want to plan across the top. 2. Sketch out your weekly eats.

Once you know how many meals you’ll need, it’s time to find some healthy recipes and fill in your calendar for the week. Here are some tips to help.</p> <p>Create a master recipe list Having a list of go-to meals is one of the easiest ways to expedite the meal planning process. Consider trying one or two new recipes and use a few old favorites to fill in the gaps. Every time you find a new meal you love, add it to the rotation! Find a few new dishes to try Finding delicious, healthy recipes isn’t hard–you just need to know where to look.

Meal planning pro and Cook Smarts founder, Jess Dang, says, “Good meal planning is like putting together a puzzle. Try to avoid selecting different recipes that don’t fit together or else you’ll be buying a lot of different ingredients. Select one, look at the ingredient list and let that help you select recipe #2, and so on.”</p> <p>Whether you use a simple notecard, a printable template or prefer a digital version, it’s a good idea to keep a paper copy of your calendar in plain view. “Making your meal plan visual may hold you more accountable for executing on the cooking. Plus, your family isn’t constantly asking you, “What’s for dinner?” They can just refer to the board, ” adds Jess. If you prefer digital, create a sub-calendar for your meal plan in Google, Outlook or your calendar application of choice and share it with family members or roommates so everyone knows the plan. Write your grocery list Save yourself some time and write your grocery list while you fill out your calendar–and don’t forget to jot down quantities for each ingredient. Before you head to the store take a quick inventory of what you have on hand and cross off the ingredients you don’t need to purchase.</p> </span> <div id="page-meta" class="t30"> <p> <!-- Look the author details up from the site config. --> <!-- Output author details if some exist. --> <time class="icon-calendar pr20" datetime="2015-08-29" itemprop="datePublished"> 2015-08-29</time> <span class="icon-archive pr20"> VEGETARIAN-FOOD-AND-COOKING</span> <br> <span class="pr20"><span class="icon-price-tag pr10"> vegetarian-food-and-cooking</span> </span> </p> <div id="post-nav" class="row"> <div class="small-5 columns"><a class="button small radius prev" href="https://diyeasyprojects.github.io/prosperity-pursuit/seek-inspiration/">&laquo; Seek Inspiration</a></div><!-- /.small-4.columns --> <div class="small-2 columns text-center"><a class="radius button small" href="https://diyeasyprojects.github.io/blog/archive/" title="Blog Archive">Archive</a></div><!-- /.small-4.columns --> </div> </div><!-- /.page-meta --> <h3 id="comments" class="t60">Dialogue &amp; Discussion</h3> <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script type="text/javascript"> /* * * CONFIGURATION VARIABLES: EDIT BEFORE PASTING INTO YOUR WEBPAGE * * */ var disqus_shortname = 'diyeasyprojects'; var disqus_identifier = '/vegetarian-food-and-cooking/a-begginers-guide-to-meal-planning/'; /* * * DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE * * */ (function() { var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true; dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js'; (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq); })(); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> </article> </div><!-- /.medium-8.columns --> <div class="medium-4 columns"> <aside> <div class="panel side-presentation"> <h3 class="center-no-padding">Get your free Forex Trading Ebook here!</h3> <img class="responsive-image cover-max-height" src="https://diyeasyprojects.github.io/images//thumb/forex-trading.jpg" alt="forex-trading-cover"> <p>In an emerging economy like the one we're living nowadays, profiting from it's growth gets easy like 1,2,3 by using forex.
