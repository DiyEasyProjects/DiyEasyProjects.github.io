        <div style=TEXT-ALIGN:left>
          <font size=3>Dear friend,<br>
          <br>
          Finally, you CAN attract sexy, fun-loving, interesting women -- total "10's" -- WITHOUT any of the difficulties of traditional dating or "pick-up" game.</font><font size=3><br>
          <br>
          How I stumbled upon this "rogue" seduction system is very interesting ...<br>
          <br>
          Just a few years ago, I was a LOSER when it came to women.<br>
          <br>
          I wasn't "the 40 year old virgin", but my success with women was well <u>below</u> average.<br>
          <br>
          Around my friends, I was fine. I was relaxed and sociable. Hell, I was just FUN to be around.<br>
          <br>
          But whenever I was near an attractive woman, I became NERVOUS and AWKWARD.<br>
          <br>
          I would FREEZE UP, forget what I "should" say, or else I would talk too fast and make a fool of myself.<br>
          <br>
          It got so bad -- the nervousness, the pain of rejection, the lack of control I felt -- that I decided to NEVER approach an attractive woman.<br>
          <br>
          I'm guessing you can relate to this ... (all men have felt this way at some point in their lives.)<br>
          <br>
          </font>
          <div style=TEXT-ALIGN:center>
            <b><font size=5>I Was Lonely. I Was Sexually Frustrated.<br>
            And Deep Down Inside, <u>I Hated Myself</u>.</font><br>
            </b>
          </div>
          <font size=3><br>
          Are you totally happy with the women in your life?<br>
          <br>
          Are you surrounded by beautiful, interesting women who love YOU for who YOU are?<br>
          <br>
          If the honest answer is "No", <b>I feel your pain ...</b><br>
          <br>
          Feelings of <u>inadequacy</u> ... of being totally uncomfortable around the very women you are MOST attracted to .. are the <u>WORST</u> feelings a man can feel.<br>
          <br>
          The worst part is, when you're lonely, and you don't understand <i>why</i>, you begin to blame yourself.<br>
          <br>
          It's time to STOP BLAMING YOURSELF and take the next step.<br>
          <br>
          I've felt just like you've felt ... and I decided to NEVER feel that way again.<br>
          <br>
          Yes, I REFUSED to be alone for the rest of my life.<br>
          <br>
          I decided to do <i>something</i> ...<font size=5><br>
          <br>
          </font></font>
          <div style=TEXT-ALIGN:center>
            <font size=5><b>I Tried "Pick Up Game" -- And It Worked. (Sort Of...)</b><br>
            </font>
          </div>
          <font size=3><br>
          I REALIZED that the way I was acting around women wasn't working ...<br>
          <br>
          ... so I adopted a <u>completely different persona.</u><br>
          <br>
          I put on weird clothes to attract attention, like platform shoes and big sunglasses.<br>
          <br>
          When I approached a woman, I used canned lines and routines I picked up from books and DVDs.<br>
          <br>
          I even changed my name!<br>
          <br>
          Everything I said or did was in a calculated manner in order to get a woman attracted to me.<br>
          <br>
          And let me tell you, it WASN'T WORTH IT.<br>
          <br>
          Sure, I was hooking up with a few more women.<br>
          <br>
          But it was a CHORE talking to them.<br>
          <br>
          I had to constantly "run game".<br>
          <br>
          I had to always remember what I had to say, how I had to act, and what I had to do.<br>
          <br>
          I realized, after attending a $3,000 "boot camp", <b>the "seduction industry" <u>only wants your money. </u></b><br>
          <br>
          They are NOT concerned about <i>your</i> success with women, or your happiness.<br>
          <br>
          And although I had a few fun Friday nights, deep down inside <i>I was as lonely as ever.<br>
          <br>
          Until ...<br>
          </i></font><font size=3><br>
          </font>
          <div style=TEXT-ALIGN:center>
            <font size=5>Finally, My Heart <i>Racing</i>, I Discovered The Obvious <u>Secret</u> To Attracting Beautiful Women ...<br>
<br>
<b>... And <u>DAMN</u>, Did It <i>Work!</i></b></font><br>

            <div style=TEXT-ALIGN:left>
              <font size=3><br>
              Ask any woman how to be successful with women, and she'll tell you...<br>
              <br>
              "Be yourself."<br>
              <br>
              Is this a <u>lie</u>?<br>
              <br>
              I used to think so ...<br>
              <br>
              But what if "being yourself" means something <i>completely different </i>than what you thought it means?<br>
		<ul>
		<li>
              "Be yourself" means -- don't be that nervous fool desperate to compliment a girl he doesn't even know.</li><br>
              <br>
              <li>"Be yourself" means -- don't adopt some phoney "player persona" the million-dollar seduction industry want to sell you.</li><br>
              <br>
              <li>"Be yourself" means --- be the way you are around your best friends, (with SOME important differences) and you'll attract the type of women you'll like best.</li>
             
              </font>
            </div>
          </div>
          <font size=3>This "magic concept" works if you're handsome, rich, and confident with women ... or if you're the "40 year old virgin" living alone in your parents' basement, with ZERO confidence and a history of "bad relationships".<br>

          This mind-bending way to attract women works WHILE you're having fun.<br>
