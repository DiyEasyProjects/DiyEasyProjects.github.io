                  Friend,</span></font></p>
                <p><span lang=EN-US
    style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Georgia'>You love dogs--  and you want a dog!  Many people feel exactly the way you do!  This is certainly no surprise, because dogs are wonderful animals and they make excellent pets.  A dog can bring lots of fun, friendship, and joy to your life!</span></p>
                <p><span lang=EN-US
    style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Georgia'>However, if you really think about it, you probably do not only want to own a dog, you want it to be the best experience in the world for you, your new pet, and your entire family.  You want to be as delighted with your dog years from now as when you first adopt him.  The catch is you may not be sure of exactly how to make this happen…</span></p>
                <p align="center"><font size="5" face="Tahoma"><strong>All it takes is a little knowledge and preparation...</strong></font></p>
                <p><span lang=EN-US
    style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Georgia'>Embarking on the great experience of being a dog owner is an exciting adventure.  Unfortunately, this experience does not come with an instruction manual.  Often all it takes is making one small mistake to turn adopting a dog into a disaster.  You may not like your dog, or he may not like you.  You might decide that he is more trouble than you had bargained for.  At its worst, you may regret the decision to adopt a dog entirely.</span></p>
                <p><span lang=EN-US
    style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Georgia'>The good news is none of these things need to happen!  You can get the dog you want--  the one that is right for you--  and have a lifetime of fun, companionship, and great times with your new canine friend!</span></p>
                <p align="center"><font size="5" face="Tahoma"><strong>Adopting a Dog - What You need to Know...</strong></font></p>
                <p><span lang=EN-US
    style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Georgia'>Please do not even consider taking a new dog home with you without first reading this book!  No matter how much you want a dog, or how long you have been hoping to get one, some knowledge and preparation is absolutely essential to make the adoption a success!  </span></p>
                <p><span lang=EN-US
    style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Georgia'>You cannot afford to make the mistake of adopting a dog without adequate knowledge and preparation first!  What do you think would happen if you hastily adopt the dog you believe you want, only later to change your mind?  A few days or months later, you might decide you made a mistake!  You might blame the dog or yourself for the adoption not working out!  Surely you do not want to take this risk!  This happens to many people--  because they did not take the time to learn what they needed to know beforehand!</span></p>
                <p><span lang=EN-US
    style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Georgia'>Other people have had a different kind of bad experience in adopting.  They choose the kind of dog they want, and begin to truly love their new pet, only to find that the dog they chose required too much upkeep and cost too much to maintain.  This is the kind of thing that can easily happen when you don’t put some time into learning about the dog before you adopt him!</span></p>
                <p><span lang=EN-US
    style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Georgia'>You don’t want to risk giving a dog a new home and then letting him down when you find you can’t keep him--  or breaking your family’s hearts when you decide that this particular dog was more than you bargained for!  None of these experiences have to happen to you--  if you get all of the facts before you adopt!</span></p>
