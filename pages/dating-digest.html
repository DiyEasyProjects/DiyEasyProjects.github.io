<p><strong>Dear Friend,</strong></p>

<p>Is the fact that you would like to get a grip on the rules for dating but just don’t know how making your life difficult… maybe even miserable?</p>

<p>Does it seem like you’ve tried everything in your power to figure it out, and yet, despite your best intentions, you’re still plagued with:</p>

<ul>
    <li class="arrow">Not knowing even the basics</li>
    <li class="arrow">Not understanding even where to start with planning a date</li>
    <li class="arrow">Not knowing how to start with what you should and shouldn't talk about</li>
</ul>

<p>If this describes you, then you are in luck today…</p>

<p>First, you are NOT alone! It may seem like it sometimes, but not knowing how to get started with the riles for dating is far more common than you’d think.</p>

<p>I ought to know, because I’ve been in the same spot before…</p>

<h3 class="center bold red">"Why Understanding All The Ins And Outs Of Dating Is Crucial!"</h3>

<p><strong>This is one area you must pay attention to…</strong></p>

<p>Dating isn’t for everyone and there are some people who have not gone on dates in five years or more.</p>

<p>Sometimes we wonder why we still see these people falling into serious relationships.</p>

<p>It’s because everything just falls into place. They don’t have to make it happen since they aren’t looking to be in a relationship.</p>

<p>Now, if you have a relationship guide that discusses the do’s and don’ts of dating - you’ll have the upper hand.</p>

<p>Let me explain…</p>

<p>Obviously, you don’t want to meet your date wearing large suspenders, dirty boots, and oil stains on your face.</p>

<p>Your excuse might as well had been “Oh, I decided to roll in the mud before I saw you”.</p>

<p>By dressing well for your date, they will have a better judgment of you. Believe it or not but everyone judges someone, usually within the first few seconds of meeting.</p>

<p>Anything that seems slightly out of place is easy for a person to pick up. For example, if you meet someone and you recently took off your class ring, they might think you are married.</p>

<p>This is because they see the crease where the ring was. Even the smallest things can set them off and make someone think negatively of you.</p>

<p>And the worst part? The more you don’t know the less you will succeed!</p>

<p>Make no mistake about it…</p>

<h3 class="center bold red">"The Costs of NOT Getting All The Info You Need Are Just Too High!"</h3>

<p>Your lack of knowledge in this area may not be your fault, but that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t – or can’t – do anything to find out everything you need to know to finally be a success!</p>

<p>The costs of continuing to repeat this pattern are just too steep…</p>

<p>I mean, think about all of the money you’re wasting because of how continuing to try things that don’t work costs you money… the time you’re losing due to going around in circles is also time-consuming…</p>

<p>… and that’s not to mention the toll it’s taking on your personal life, like the way the failed attempts over and over can impact personal life/relationships.</p>

<p>So today – in the next FEW MINUTES, in fact – we’re going to help you GET ON TRACK, and learn how you can quickly and easily get your dating issues under control… for GOOD!</p>

<p>That is why I’ve written this book…</p>
