**Dear Friend,**

Do you know what one of the **fastest and easiest ways to make money online is?**

*Building a targeted mailing list and then broadcasting promotional based messages to a **confirmed** audience of subscribers.*

Make sense, right? You simply offer an opt-in incentive to potential subscribers to capture attention, add them to your list and start sending out advertisements and offers that they'll respond to.

Except, there's one small problem with this formula: For most people, it's a LOT easier said than done.

So while there's no disputing the fact that email marketing is a BILLION DOLLAR industry, the real question is..

**"How do you start collecting leads and recruiting ACTIVE subscribers who will actually respond to your offers?"**

Before I answer that question, let's rewind things a bit because it might not even be apparent to you **WHY** you are losing money by not building a mailing list.

We need to stay one step ahead of our competition, and a mailing list just seems like too much work, or maybe something that can just be pushed back until we have 'more time'.

<h3 class="center red bold">You don't have a mailing list OR you don't have a TARGETED mailing list that you can instantly monetize!</h3>

Even if you spent **less than 1/4 of your time** building a responsive, targeted mailing list, you would instantly **TRIPLE your online income** <u>AND</u> you'd not only make **MORE MONEY** but you would instantly maximize your exposure **all at the same time!**

<span class="bold x2 red">Bottom line:</span> Building a responsive mailing list for your business <u class="bold">IS</u> one of the **most important**, and **most easiest way** to **skyrocket your income** and **get more done - in less time**.

Building a <u>targeted mailing list</u> for your online business will:
