<p>Have you ever wondered why most people are fraught with medical problems?</p>

<p>Isn’t it strange that high blood pressure, constipation and general body aches have come to be accepted as routine or common nowadays?</p>

<p>Do you know the reason behind your impulsive, passionate reactions, or even the feeling of anxiousness?</p>

<p>You were not born with these health problems or character traits. You have acquired them as you grew up.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, most people get these traits from eating non-vegetarian food!</p>

<h3 class="center bold red">Save Your Health, Wealth and Environment by Becoming a Vegetarian</h3>

<p>The American Dietetic Association (ADA) claims that approximately 2.5% of the adult population in the US follows a diet free of non-vegetarian food, such as meat, poultry or fish.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the ADA states that more and more people are turning towards flexitarianism which facilitates the benefits of occasional meat, fish and poultry intake along with a vegetarian diet.</p>

<p>A World Health Organization (WHO) report mentioned that over 159 diseases are rooted in non-vegetarian foodstuff.</p>

<p>Heart problems, cancer, obesity, diabetes, food borne illnesses as well as hypertension have their roots in meats and poultry.</p>

<p>The total medical cost in the US that is attributable to the consumption of meat is estimated to be in between $30 and $60 per year!</p>

<p>With these facts and figures, you must have realized the numerous benefits of adopting a vegetarian dietary pattern.</p>
