Have you ever wondered why most people are fraught with medical problems? 

Isn’t it strange that high blood pressure, constipation and general body aches have come to be accepted as routine or common nowadays? 

Do you know the reason behind your impulsive, passionate reactions, or even the feeling of anxiousness? 

You were not born with these health problems or character traits. You have acquired them as you grew up. 

Surprisingly, most people get these traits from eating non-vegetarian food!

<h3 class="center bold red">Save Your Health, Wealth and Environment by Becoming a Vegetarian</h3>

The American Dietetic Association (ADA) claims that approximately 2.5% of the adult population in the US follows a diet free of non-vegetarian food, such as meat, poultry or fish. 

Furthermore, the ADA states that more and more people are turning towards flexitarianism which facilitates the benefits of occasional meat, fish and poultry intake along with a vegetarian diet. 

A World Health Organization (WHO) report mentioned that over 159 diseases are rooted in non-vegetarian foodstuff. 

Heart problems, cancer, obesity, diabetes, food borne illnesses as well as hypertension have their roots in meats and poultry. 

The total medical cost in the US that is attributable to the consumption of meat is estimated to be in between $30 and $60 per year! 

With these facts and figures, you must have realized the numerous benefits of adopting a vegetarian dietary pattern.
